# Gravix
Gravix is a 2D platformer with ~35 single screen levels, an interconnected map and collectibles to find! Mechanics are very similar to [VVVVVV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/70300/VVVVVV/). 
Featuring music from the [PPPPPP](https://souleyedigitalmusic.bandcamp.com/album/pppppp-the-vvvvvv-soundtrack) soundtrack (not mine). Sprites and sound effects are hand-made.

This game was made in 30 days with NO Unity knowledge, my first game ever, you could say.
Room transitions can be much better, can handle input differently... It's a good start!

## Controls
